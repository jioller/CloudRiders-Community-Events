# This is the main event repository for my community and other collabs:
# #####################################################################

This is the repository that has been created to store different content, templates, comments, etc. about the events that we are going to organize.

Please, if you are collaborating with us in an event, we ask you to take into account the following points:
1. Be close and friendly with the other speakers and attendees.
2. Respond to queries whenever possible.
3. Stay open to different points of view.
4. Make all your presentations accessible to people with special needs.

Whenever you have doubts, contact me for help:
